			What
		</div>
		<div class="text">
			Generic-Text-Adventure seeks to provide a simple way to create a text adventure game given a series of text documents and pointers
			within them (or something like that).
			
			This is inspired by Twine 2.
		</div>
		<div class="subtitle">
			Why
		</div>
		<div class="text">
			It is easy to create a single text adventure, where the branching paths and decisions are hard-coded into the file. However, creating
			a system that is able to generate any text adventure with user input is a more difficult task.
		</div>
		<div class="subtitle">
			With What
		</div>
		<div class="text">
			This will only be made with Javascript, HTML, CSS, etc.
