			<div class="subtitle">
				What
			</div>
			<div class="text">
				Generic-Text-Adventure seeks to provide a simple way to create a text adventure game given a series of text documents and pointers
				within them (or something like that).
				
				This is inspired by Twine 2.
			</div>
			
			<div class="subtitle">
				Why
			</div>
			<div class="text">
				It is easy to create a single text adventure, where the branching paths and decisions are hard-coded into the file. However, creating
				a system that is able to generate any text adventure with user input is a more difficult task.
			</div>
			
			<div class="subtitle">
				Who
			</div>
			<div class="text">
				This expects users to be familiar with very basic web programming if the user wants to change the CSS of the text adventure and to be
				capable of following specific rules for determining variables, choices, etc., but not want to worry with the implementation of a text
				adventure. 
			</div>
			
			<div class="subtitle">
				With What
			</div>
			<div class="text">
				This will mainly be made with Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
			</div>
			
		<div class="title">
			Overview
		</div>
		
			<div class="text">
				At its core, Generic-Text-Adventure is about organized text processing. The high-level organization will likely change once it's
				further developed, but these are the loose ideas.
			</div>
		
			<div class="subtitle">
				Hierarchy
			</div>
			<div class="text">
				The organization for the Text-Adventure is as follows:
					<ol>
						<li> Game </li>
						<li> Acts </li>
						<li> Scenes </li>
						<li> Snippets </li>
					</ol>
				Twine 2 doesn't use this organization system, and only uses "Snippets" to connect the story. This is a good system to use for shorter
				and less linear stories, where the story is not neatly separated into separate parts. However, the benefit that propels this idea is
				for users to not have to look through bulky lists of text files in order to edit and add onto specific elements of their story. Even
				more abstract and non-linear stories might be able to separate their narrative based on unique organization (ex: stories with a time
				mechanic could separate scenes into time increments).
			</div>
			<div class="text">
				A Snippet is the smallest piece of the text adventure. They are the nodes of a graph, connected by the branching choices within one
				Snippet. When at the end of the Scene, a Snippet will transition from one Scene to another that does not necessarily have to be
				chronological.
			</div>
			<div class="text">
				A Scene are purely for organizational purposes, storing the Snippets within a proper containers. Transitioning from Scene to Scene
				does not directly give a pointer from one Scene to another. Instead, each Scene will be given a starting Snippet that the User will
				go to.
			</div>
			<div class="text">
				The same applies to Acts, except that it will be given a starting Scene, which will also be given a starting Snippet. While this might
				seem debilitating to those who want to start the Act at different Scenes, or the Scene at different Snippets, the entire point of these
				distinctions is to segregate the different aspects of the story into different uniform parts. From there, there could be different
				text inside the Snippet, as well as drastically different Snippets from the stating position.
			</div>
			
		<div class="subtitle">
			User
		</div>
		<div class="text">
			The user will be represented as a single Snippet Node. As it traverses throughout the Snippets, it will not have any memory of the pervious
			Snippet, nor any knowledge of what the next Snippets are other than the pointer to them.
